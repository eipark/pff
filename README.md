# Park Family Farm

## Farmstand
Our farmstand is located on Amsterdam Drive at the corner of the vineyard and the fence ([see map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Park+Family+Farm+Farmstand/@40.4666451,-74.5904423,15.98z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x2cbfc77a6621bd3d:0xfcccc0734c14bc36!8m2!3d40.4684588!4d-74.5844848!16s%2Fg%2F11sppb7c1r?entry=ttu)).

We put out our pastured eggs for self-service purchasing in the mini fridge at the stand. Right now we have extremely limited avilability, there is no set schedule, and it's first come first serve. $7, cash or venmo.


## About us
We're a tiny farm in Hillsborough NJ along the Millstone River. Our mission is to steward our land, grow healthy food, and be a positive influence on the community.

We primarily raise hens on pasture and sell delicious eggs. We'll also occasionally put other produce on our farmstand.

## Community
We proudly support the Franklin Food Bank and Feeding Hands Pantry with eggs and personal donations. If you're local, we ask you consider supporting these organizations in their missions to solve food insecurity and other important issues that affect our neighbors.
