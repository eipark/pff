# Park Family Farm

## Farmstand
Unfortunately, do to frequent theft, we've had to pause our self-serve egg stand. Instead, if you want to pick up eggs, please call Steve at 551-215-2589 and arrange pickup. $7/dozen, cash or venmo.


## About us
We're a tiny farm in Hillsborough NJ along the Millstone River. Our mission is to steward our land, grow healthy food, and be a positive influence on the community.

We primarily raise hens on pasture and sell delicious eggs. We'll also occasionally put other produce on our farmstand.

## Community
We proudly support the [Franklin Food Bank](https://franklinfoodbank.org/) and [Feeding Hands Pantry](https://www.feedinghandspantry.org/) with eggs and personal donations. If you're local, we ask you consider supporting these organizations in their missions to solve food insecurity and other important issues that affect our neighbors. If you need help with food, these organizations can help.
